## 4. Page Structure & Copy Blueprint

### A. Hero Section (The "Global Elite" Hook)

**Headline:**
> "World-Class Education. Now Targeting Baldwin County."

**Sub-headline:**
> "We are organizing a Founding Family cohort to bring **Alpha**—the school producing the top 1% of academic outcomes globally—to the Eastern Shore."

**Primary CTA:** "Apply for the Founding Cohort" (Orange Button)

**Social Proof Bar:**
> "As seen in: *The Austin American-Statesman*, *EdSurge*, and *Cognitive Revolution*."

---

### B. The "Extreme Outcomes" Section (Data-First)

> **Context:** This section replaces the "philosophy" with hard stats. It answers "Does it work?" immediately.

**Headline:** "Outliers by Design."

**Layout:** 3-Column Stat Grid (Dark Background, White Text)

#### Stat 1: Academic Velocity

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **"2x Speed"** | Alpha students learn 2x the amount of material in the same time as traditional peers. By high school, many have completed college coursework. |
| *Reference* | "Based on MAP Growth data top 2% nationally." |

#### Stat 2: Ivy League & Elite Admissions

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **"Top 1%"** | Graduates have been accepted to Stanford, UT Austin Honors, and other elite institutions. The '2-Hour' model does not compromise rigor; it accelerates it. |

#### Stat 3: Real World Agency

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **"High Agency"** | Students don't just study history; they build apps, launch businesses, and win robotics championships. |

**Quote Block (Prominent):**
> "The results are extreme. We are seeing kids master core subjects in 2 hours a day and spend the rest of their time becoming elite at their passions."
>
> — *Angus Davis, Tech Entrepreneur & Investor*

### C. The Alpha Model (The Product)

**Headline:** "The 2-Hour Learning Model."

**Sub-headline:** "Traditional school is 6 hours of lecture. Alpha is 2 hours of mastery."

#### Component 1: Adaptive AI (8am - 11am)

> "Apps that adapt to your child's pace. If they are ahead, they soar. If they are stuck, it slows down. No gaps. 100% Mastery."

#### Component 2: Life Skills & Masterpieces (12pm - 3pm)

> "Public speaking, financial literacy, and 'Masterpieces'—projects that look impressive on a college resume (and in real life)."

## 5. Implementation Notes

### Language Guidelines

| DO Use | DO NOT Use |
|--------|------------|
| Campus | Homeschool |
| Tuition | Co-op |
| Enrollment | Hybrid |
| Academics | |

### Tone

Use **"Institutional"** language throughout. This is a premium private school, not an alternative education experiment.

### Data Visualization

When creating the "Extreme Outcomes" section, use **large, bold numbers**. It should look like an investor pitch deck slide.
